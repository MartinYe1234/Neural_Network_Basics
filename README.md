# Neural_Network_Basics

A project created with Ryan that implements the ideas discussed in the 2Blue1Brown video tutorials on Neural Networks.
We have included a feature that automatically generates a gif showing all the results, these show the confidence values, the image, the network's guess and the actual answer.
This was done using features matplotlib.pyplot and numpy.
Another file which was meant to allow you to draw your own numbers is also included.
